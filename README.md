## Features

- Find gluten-free grocery stores and specialty shops  
- Locate essential health professionals  
- Access national foundations for up-to-date medical and dietary information  
- Connect with local support groups

The pipeline was developed in terms of a final project at WBS Coding School's Data Analytics course.  
Data was sourced from 6 different APIs and further scraped from 4 different websites.  
A one-man, ten day, google cloud console free trial-budget prototype, so far it includes data on 13 cities - from Tokyo to Buenos Airies - and is hosted on a rudimentary Streamlit website linked above.  
However, it has potential for global scaling.  
The data aqcuisition and filtering process is fully automated and localized.  
Complex, multi-lingual query system and filters that help side-step false positives and SEO manipulation work in every language in Google Translate catalogue.

I will further develop app by gradually adding new cities and functionalities.  
Plans include employing NLP for post-processing and moving the pipeline to a more interactive front-end interface.

## 🛠️ The Pipeline

Celiwise was developed in terms of a final project at WBS Coding School's Data Analytics course.

Data was sourced from:
- 6 different APIs  
- 4 celiac-related websites (via web scraping)

I used Python (pandas, numpy, requests, BeautifulSoup) and MySQL80

---

## ⚙️ Current Scope

A one-man, ten day, google cloud console free trial-budget prototype, so far it includes data on  13 cities - from Tokyo to Buenos Airies - and is hosted on a rudimentary Streamlit website.

However, the pipeline has potential for global scaling.

## 🌍 Global Reach

- The aqcuisition and filtering process is fully automated and localized  
- Complex, multi-lingual query system and filters  help side-step false positives and SEO manipulation  
- Works in every language in Google Translate catalogue

---

## 🚀 Future

I will further develop the app by gradually adding new cities and functionalities.

Plans include:
- Employing NLP for post-processing  
- Moving the pipeline to a more interactive front-end interface
